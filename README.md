# Rotris - Tetris but with a "Twist" of the playing field

## Concept
  This is a game of Tetris, but with the added twist that the player can rotate the playing field in 90Â° increments clockwise and counter clockwise.
  To add more to the playing field rotation, gravity to the currently played blocks, as a collective single "block", is applied and slides to the new bottom of the playing field.

  Watch out rotating the playing field though! The top of the playing field rotates and adjusts with the new positon of the playing field and could fill up quick on its side!
